Managing TA for the largest [Bayesian statistics course](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) in Finland. Over 350 students from varied background, but mostly MSc computer science students. I helped design course content, including contributing to lecture slides. I gave lectures and managed TA sessions. Course content is taught using weekly code based assignments alongside final project presentation.
